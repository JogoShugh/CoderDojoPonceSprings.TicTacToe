Before attempting to build a computer program, it's important to take some time to think about what you want to achieve, but without worrying about what the code will look like.

Some people call this step design. Others call it modeling. Some call it analysis.

I just call it thinking. Let's start thinking.

# Exercise 1: Write down what you know about Tic Tac Toe

## Now let's think about how you play a typical pen and paper game of Tic Tac Toe

### Step 1: Take 3 to 5 minutes and think about the following aspects of a typical pen and paper game of Tic Tac Toe:

* What does the board that you draw look like? How many parts does it have, and what do you call them?
* How many players are in a game, and what symbols do they use?
* Who makes the first move, and what do they do?
* How does play alternate between players?
* When does a game end with a winner? 
* What are the different directions a winner can win with?
* When is a game over, but with a tie? 

### Step 2: Write your thoughts down

* Write down what comes to your mind, in plain English phrases or sentences. You can write on paper, or you can type it into the text box below. **While the mechanics and rules of such a simple game might seem like common sense to you, it's still important that you try this on your own first, because we'll be referring to your notes later when you play on paper, and when you build the game using code.** 
* Once you've done this, then compare your answers to what I came up with below. Your answers may differ. They are probably no worse or better than my own, but if you had any difficulty then my answers can help you.

### Step 3: Compare your thoughts with mine

* A tic tac toe board consists of 3 rows, each row containing 3 empty squares, for a total of 9 squares.
* A game has two players, player X, and player O.
* The first player to play is X, and makes the first move by drawing an X in one of the empty squares.
* After the first move, player O makes a move by drawing an O in one of the empty squares, and then play alternates between the two players.
* When one player has successfully put their letter in 3 contiguous squares, then that player is the winner.
* The squares may be contiguous horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
* If all 9 squares get filled without either player connecting 3-in-a-row, then the game is a tie, or a "cats game".

# Exercise 2: Play a few games on paper with a friend

Game time!

### Step 1: Play a game with one set of rules

* Pair up with a classmate
* Decide whose notes you will follow first
* Play a game on paper using the rules defined by the notes you just selected
* Play a rematch!

### Step 2: Play a game with another set of rules

* Now, use the other person's notes as rules to play the third game
  * Probably they are the same, but see if you find any slight differences!
* Play another rematch!
