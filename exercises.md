Before attempting to build a computer program, it's important to take some time to think about what you want to achieve, but without worrying about what the code will look like.

Some people call this step design. Others call it modeling. Some call it analysis.

I just call it thinking.

# Thinking about the game of Tic Tac Toe

Think about how you play a typical game of Tic Tac Toe on paper for a few moments. Think about the board that you draw, the rules for how you make moves, alternate turns, and ultimately how one player wins, and how a game can end in a tie.

Now, write down what comes to your mind, in plain English phrases or sentences. You should do this on your own first,
then compare your answers to what I came up with. Your answers may differ. They are probably no worse or better than my own.

My thoughts:

* A tic tac toe board consists of 3 rows, each row containing 3 empty squares, for a total of 9 squares.
* The game has two players, player X, and player O.
* The first player to play is X.
* A player makes a move by drawing an X or an O in one of the epmty squares.
* If a player can put their letter in 3 connected squares, whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, then that player is the winner.
* If all 9 squares get filled without either player connecting 3-in-a-row, then the game is a tie, or a "cats game".
