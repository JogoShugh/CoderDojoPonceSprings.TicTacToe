Before attempting to build a computer program, it's important to take some time to think about what you want to achieve, but without worrying about what the code will look like.

Some people call this step design. Others call it modeling. Some call it analysis.

I just call it thinking.

# Exercise 1: Thinking about the game of Tic Tac Toe

## Now let's think about how you play a typical pen and paper game of Tic Tac Toe

Take 3 to 5 minutes and think about the following aspects of a typical pen and paper game of Tic Tac Toe:

* The board that you draw: how many parts does it have? What do you call them?
* The rules for who makes the first move
* The rules of alternating turns
* How one player wins, and the different directions the player can take to win
* Or, how a game can end in a tie

Next, do this:

* Write down what comes to your mind, in plain English phrases or sentences. You can write on paper, or you can type it into the text box below. **It's important that you try this on your own first, because we'll be referring to your notes later when you build the game.** 
* Once you've done this, then compare your answers to what I came up with below. Your answers may differ. They are probably no worse or better than my own, but if you had any difficulty then my answers can help you.

My thoughts:

* A tic tac toe board consists of 3 rows, each row containing 3 empty squares, for a total of 9 squares.
* The game has two players, player X, and player O.
* The first player to play is X.
* A player makes a move by drawing an X or an O in one of the epmty squares.
* If a player can put their letter in 3 connected squares, whether horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, then that player is the winner.
* If all 9 squares get filled without either player connecting 3-in-a-row, then the game is a tie, or a "cats game".
