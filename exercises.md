Before attempting to build a computer program, it's important to take some time to think about what you want to achieve, but without worrying about what the code will look like.

Some people call this step design. Others call it modeling. Some call it analysis.

I just call it thinking. Let's start thinking.

# Exercise 1: Write down what you know about Tic Tac Toe

## Now let's think about how you play a typical pen and paper game of Tic Tac Toe

### Step 1: Take 3 to 5 minutes and think about the following aspects of a typical pen and paper game of Tic Tac Toe:

* What does the board that you draw look like? How many parts does it have, and what do you call them?
* How many players are in a game, and what symbols do they use?
* Who makes the first move, and what do they do?
* When does a game end with a winner? 
* What are the different directions a winner can win with?
* When is a game over, but with a tie? 

### Step 2: Write your thoughts down

* Write down what comes to your mind, in plain English phrases or sentences. You can write on paper, or you can type it into the text box below. **It's important that you try this on your own first, because we'll be referring to your notes later when you build the game.** 
* Once you've done this, then compare your answers to what I came up with below. Your answers may differ. They are probably no worse or better than my own, but if you had any difficulty then my answers can help you.

### Step 3: Compare your thoughts with mine

* A tic tac toe board consists of 3 rows, each row containing 3 empty squares, for a total of 9 squares
* A game has two players, player X, and player O
* The first player to play is X
* A player makes a move by drawing an X or an O in one of the epmty squares, and then play aternates to the next player
* When one player has successfully put their letter in 3 contiguous squares, then that player is the winner. The squares may be contiguous horizontall, vertically, or diagonally
* If all 9 squares get filled without either player connecting 3-in-a-row, then the game is a tie, or a "cats game"
