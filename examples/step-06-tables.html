  <tr>
    <td>table</td>
    <td>Sets up the start of a table, a container for groups of rows and columns. The <code>table</code> tag can directly contain <code>tr</code> child tags.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>tr</td>
    <td>Creates a table row. Rows stack horizontally on top of each other. The <code>tr</code> tag directly contains child <code>td</code> tags.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>td</td>
    <td>This means "table detail", but you can think of it like a column. You can write multipe <code>td</code> tags next to each other, and they line up side-by-side, or vertically within the row.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>th</td>
    <td>This means "table header", and it has basically the same behavior as the <code>td</code> tag, but it automatically makes any text you put between its starting and closing tags <strong>bold</strong> and centered. You can change that if you want. You typically place
    these tags in the very first <code>tr</code> tag so that they identify the meaning of the <code>td</code> tags in the rest of the rows.
