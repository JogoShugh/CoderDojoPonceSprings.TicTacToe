		Sir Tim Berners-Lee (TBL) invented the WWW (World Wide Web) in 1990, but in the year 2089 robotic bandits went back to 1989 to capture him and send him back to another WWW: the Wild Wild West of 1889. Unfortunately for the robots, you have a plan. Your quest is to send TBL resources to help him get back to 1989 so he can create the WWW and preserve the future.
