# BLUESKY
* How about a game where there are more tiles, but you have to get at least 2-3-in-a-row, or 3, or 4?
  * What if you could give up a turn in exchange for removing the opponent's move?
  * What if you could get extra points for have more than 3 in a row, regardless of if you made it to 6 or more?
* What about a game where you had time limits for moves and got more points for moving quickly?
* What about a game where you get points specifically for blocking paths of the opponent?
* How about a game where there can be more than 2 players?
  * Like, 2 players is (2+1)^2, so maybe with 3 players the smallest size is (3+1)^2=16
  * And, with 4 players, it's 25
  * with 5, it's 36 squares
  * But, it's still a game of 3 in a row, but much harder!
* And, what about team games, where it's still multiple players, but it's played with alternating turns
  * For example, instead of just 3 in a row, it's 4 in a row, but 2 players per team
  * This would make for some funny situations
