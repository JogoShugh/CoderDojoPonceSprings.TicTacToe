# BACKLOG

We use this page to keep track of what we're doing next, what comes after that, and to record when we get things done.

1. We are working on things under **In Progress**. When we finish them, we move them to the very bottom of the page under the **DONE** heading and prefix them with a date and a comma.
2. Then, we move 3 or 4 items from the **Prioritized** section into **In Progress**
3. Around that time, we pick a few replacements from the **Identified** section that we think can and should be 
next priorities.
4. We may, if we see fit, pull items from the **BLUESKY** and break them down into some **Identified** tasks.

The **BLUESKY** section is for speculative ideas and awesome ideas. It doesn't mean we're going to specifically do that.


## In Progress

* Create personal head-to-head results scoreboard
* Create global head-to-head results scoreboard that updates as games finish


# Prioritized

## Exercises for CoderDojo Week 1

* Create exercise for showing who is the current player in a game
* Create exercise for keeping track of personal head-to-head results scoreboard
* Create exercise for displaying head-to-head reuslts on a global scoreboard as results become available
* Create exercise for adding sound when a move is made (different for X and O)
  * Create exercise for allowing specifying a custom sound for each player
* Create exercise for playing a cheer when a player wins on their screen and a boo or aww shucks on the losing 
player's screen
* Create exercise for animating the drawing of a player's move
  * Pop in, fade in, swipe in, etc (Angular animations)  
* Create exercise for allowing avatar image selection for player (small icon) and game move icon (should they be diff? What about a gallery of avatars and a common border color or superimposed transparent X or O?)

# Identified

* Create exercise for adding global chatroom
* Create exercise for adding game-specific chatroom
* Create exercise for adding private messaging
* Create exercise for adding invitation-based game (game doesn't start until the other player accepts)
* Create ability to login with Facebook
* Create ability to like on Facebook
* Add more social button support (AddThis.com?)

# BLUESKY

* How about a game where there are more tiles, but you have to get at least 2-3-in-a-row, or 3, or 4?
  * What if you could give up a turn in exchange for removing the opponent's move?
  * What if you could get extra points for have more than 3 in a row, regardless of if you made it to 6 or more?
* What about a game where you had time limits for moves and got more points for moving quickly?
* What about a game where you get points specifically for blocking paths of the opponent?
* How about a game where there can be more than 2 players?
  * Like, 2 players is (2+1)^2, so maybe with 3 players the smallest size is (3+1)^2=16
  * And, with 4 players, it's 25
  * with 5, it's 36 squares
  * But, it's still a game of 3 in a row, but much harder!
* And, what about team games, where it's still multiple players, but it's played with alternating turns
  * For example, instead of just 3 in a row, it's 4 in a row, but 2 players per team
  * This would make for some funny situations
